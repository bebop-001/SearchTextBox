I needed a couple of search-boxs that could be cleared and would
use carriage return or IME Next to indicate selection was complete.
This is the result.

The object is in SearchTextBox.java and searchbox.xml.  Example code in 
MainAction.java and main.xml.  It implements two 'search boxes' and 
initializes them.

Please feel free to use as you wish.  Attribution is appreciated though.
